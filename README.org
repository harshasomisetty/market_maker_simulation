- simulate orderbook
  1) underlying price
  2) mm order placement
     1) the market gives feedback to the mm which provides more liquidity (more of its orders are filled)
     2) mms assume that last mm will keep same strategy
  3) generate random orders around price, random volume
     1) random size
     2) for buys normal distribution centered around a uniform distribution mean diff between fair price
     3) similar for sells norm dist around uniform dist
     4) some random amount of market orders (low or high volume)
     5) cancel some orders


market steps
1) read market price, who provided most liquidity last round
2) mm1 change orders
3) mm2 change orders
4) market orders come in
5) store edge for each mm, market input on which mm gave more liq, repeat
